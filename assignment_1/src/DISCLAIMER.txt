The Lisp code used in this package for the assignment
(file "orc-battle.lisp") was taken from the website landoflisp.com.
The exact license of the code is unknown.
However, it is openly distributed, so it is assumed to be
in the public domain. The author is supposedly Conrad Barsky.

If you like the code you see in this package, consider visiting
the Land of Lisp website: landoflisp.com and maybe even buying
the book that explains how to write such a piece of code on your own.
